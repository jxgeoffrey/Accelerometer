# Accelerometer
A simple QML based accelerometer screen

The position is visualised using the inner red circle that moves within the outer bigger circle.
The current code just moves the inner circle horizontally to and fro for demo purpose.
There is a Timer QML element that access the getAccelData() function to update the position.
